	\begin{problist}
		\prob For each matrix given below, calculate its determinant.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item $A=\mat{1 & 0 \\ 2 & 4}$;

			\item $B=\mat{1 & 5 \\ 1 & 5}$;

			\item $C=\mat{1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1}$;

			\item $D=\mat{1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0}$.
		\end{enumerate}
		\prob For each of the following matrices, calculate its determinant by (1)
		using the diagonal trick, and (2) expanding along a suitable column or row.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item $E=\mat{1 & 4 & 9 \\ 7 & 6 & 5 \\ 2 & 2 & 3}$;

			\item $F=\mat{1 & 0 & 8 \\ 1 & 4 & 8 \\ 1 & 6 & 5}$;

			\item $G=\mat{2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 3}$;

			\item $H=\mat{0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0}$.
		\end{enumerate}
        \prob Let $A=\mat{1 & 1 & 1 \\ 4 & 2 & 1 \\\ 9 & 3 & 1}$. Let $\mathcal{T}:\mathbb{R}^3\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^3$, where $\mathcal{T}(\vec x)=A\vec x$.
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item Determine $\det(\mathcal{T})$;
          \item Determine $\VolChange(\mathcal{T})$;
          \item What is \(\Col(A)\)? Justify your answer.
        \end{enumerate}
        \prob (Harder) Suppose you are studying
		with your pal Kokoro. She understands $3\times 3$ formula on expanding
		along the first column, but she is quite unconfident about the formula on
		expanding along an arbitrary column/row. You are going to help her solve
		her confusion.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Explain to her, using complete English sentence, why we can expand
				along the second column. (Hint: you will probably need to use a
				theorem from Module \ref{determinant module}.)

			\item Inspired by your argument, Kokoro then developed an argument
				about the invalidity of expanding along the third columns: \emph{If
				I swap the first and the third column, the third column becomes
				the first column and I can apply the formula for expanding along
				the first column. However, this determinant differs from the
				original determinant by a sign. Thus, we cannot expand along the
				third column.} Of course, her argument is wrong. Explain, using complete
				English sentence, why her argument is wrong.

			\item Now, explain to her, using complete English sentence, why we
				can expand along the third columns. (Hint: swap columns in a smart
				way.)

			\item Finally, explain to her why we can expand along a row. (Hint: refer
				to a theorem in Module \ref{determinant module}.)
		\end{enumerate}
        \prob (Harder) Suppose $M=\mat{a & b \\ c & d}$ is invertible. Let $M^{\text{adj}}
		=\mat{d & -b \\ -c & a}$. Prove that
		$\displaystyle M^{-1}=\frac{M^{\text{adj}}}{\abs{M}}$. 
		
		\prob (Harder) In this exercise, you are going to rediscover the $2\times
		2$ formula and the famous $\det(MN)=\det(M)\det(N)$ formula (in the
		$2\times 2$ case). Let $M=\mat{a & b \\ c & d}$ and
		$N=\mat{e & f \\ g & h}$ be given.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Calculate $MN$.

			\item Using row reduction to show that $\det(MN)=(ad-bc)\det(N)$.

			\item Conclude that $\det(M)=ad-bc$.

			\item Conclude that $\det(MN)=\det(M)\det(N)$.
		\end{enumerate}
		Note that by the arbitrariness of $M$ and $N$, this actually gives us a
		proof of the $2\times 2$ formula and $\det(MN)=\det(M)\det(N)$ in the
		$2\times 2$ case. \footnote{In fact, we can generalize this exercise to
		get a formula for any $n\times n$ determinants. However, precisely
		stating the formula requires new algebraic tool, which is beyond the scope
		of the book.}
