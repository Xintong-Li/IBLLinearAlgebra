		\prob On Kokoro's farm, there is a cage with $35$ animals, some of which 
		are chickens
		and some of which are rabbits. Kokoro counted the total number of legs in the
		cage and found that there were $94$ legs in all (notably, each chicken
		has exactly two legs and each rabbit has four legs). Kokoro decides
		to use this information to figure out how many chickens and how many
		rabbits there are\footnote{ This problem based on a
		classical Chinese problem from the ancient Chinese treatise
		\emph{Mathematical Classic of Master Sun} (or \emph{Sunzi Suanjing}) written
		during 3rd to 5th centuries \textsc{a.d.}}.

		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Set up a system of linear equations that you could solve to answer
				Kokoro's question.

			\item Is the system consistent? If so, answer Kokoro's question.

			\item Kokoro wants to set up three other cages.
				For each described cage below, explain using complete English sentences,
				whether such a configuration is possible. Justify your answers using linear
				algebra.
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item Kokoro wants to set up a cage with \emph{cats}
						and \emph{dogs} (notably, each cat has exactly four legs
						and each dog has four legs) so that there are $35$
						animals in total, and the total number of legs is $94$.

					\item Kokoro wants to set up a cage with \emph{cats}
						and \emph{dogs} so that there are $35$ animals in total,
						and the total number of legs is $140$.

					\item Kokoro wants to set up a cage with \emph{chickens}
						and \emph{rabbits} so that there are $42$ animals in total,
						and the total number of legs is $77$.

		\prob For each statement below, determine whether it is true or false. Justify
		your answer.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item A system of linear equations of 4 variables with 3 equations is
				always consistent.

			\item Any system of linear equation with $0x_{1}+0x_{2}+\cdots+0x_{n}
				=0$ being one of the equations must be consistent.

			\item There are $m,c\in \R$ so that the $y$-axis is the solution set to the equation $y=mx+c$.
			
			\item There are $m,c\in \R$ so that the $x$-axis is the solution set to the equation $y=mx+c$.
			
			\item There are $m_1,m_2,c\in \R$ so that the $x$-axis (in $\R^3$) is the solution set to the equation $z=m_1x+m_2y+c$.

			\item A system of exactly one equation can have an empty solution set.
